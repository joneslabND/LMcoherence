Lake metabolism coherence analyses and manuscript
SEJ

The goal of this work is to evaluate the temporal and spatial scales of coherence in
dissolved oxygen and ecosystem metabolism rates across a set of lakes

Questions:

1.  At what temporal periods do we observe cross-lake coherence?
		
2.  At what spatial scales do we observe cross-lake coherence?
		-are there breakpoints in decay of cross-lake coherence? 
		-do different temporal periods of coherence vary differently with space?

3.  Does distance or lake chemical/physical characteristics better predict coherence?
		-do these predictors vary for different temporal periods?

4.  Can this inform predictions for lake metabolism/DO responses to global change?
